# Configuration file example

This example contains:

- A custom configuration file with custom SASS importers. You should only need custom importers if you also use them as part of your build tool.

The command to generate the proper type files would look like this (_in the root of this example, not repository_):

```bash
npm run typed-scss-modules "./**/*.scss"
```
